# Temporary Placeholder

The app is currently configured to use `/sounds/highlight.mp3`.

Until you add a real sound file, the highlighting will work silently.

To add a proper sound:
1. Download a short "marker stroke" or "swoosh" sound from freesound.org
2. Save it as `highlight.mp3` in this directory
3. The sound will automatically work

The app won't crash if the sound file is missing - it will just skip the audio.
